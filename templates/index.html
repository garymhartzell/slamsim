    <h1>Welcome to SlamSim!</h1>
	        <p>In the world of professional wrestling, there are two distinct realities: the strategic planning that happens behind the curtain and the unforgettable action that unfolds in front of the crowd. SlamSim! puts you in control of both.</p>
			        <p>Step backstage as the <strong>Booker</strong>, the mastermind who builds the roster, books the matches, and dictates the outcomes. Or join the crowd as a <strong>Fan</strong>, here to witness the results, follow the champions, and explore the official history of the promotion.</p>
