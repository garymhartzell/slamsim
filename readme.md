## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x
-   `pandas` 
-   `slugify`
-   `datetime`

### Installation

1. Install Python.  You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ironmangary/slamsim.git](https://github.com/ironmangary/slamsim.git)
    ```

3.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd slamsim
    ```

4. Optionally (but recommended), create a virtual environment for this installation using `venv`.  See [https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for more information and instructions.

5.  Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Important Note

SlamSim! is designed to be run via the command line (bash, PowerShell, etc.) in a private environment.  
**Version 1.0 Beta Limitations**:
- No graphical user interface (GUI) for adding data, such as events and wrestlers.
- No data validation or authentication is included.
- To share the content generated by SlamSim!, upload the static HTML pages from the `public` directory to your web server.

### Setting Preferences and Adding Content

All preferences and content are managed using JSON files located in the `data` directory. Follow these steps:

1. **Create JSON Files**  
   - Use a spreadsheet program to create CSV files for your data.
   - Convert the CSV files to JSON using the provided script.

2. **Run the Conversion Script**
   - To convert a single CSV file:
     ```bash
     python bin/csv-json.py -f prefs.csv
     ```
     This generates `data/prefs.json` for use with the software.

   - To convert all CSV files in the `data` directory (batch mode):
     ```bash
     python bin/csv-json.py -b data
     ```

### Running

Once you have created the data you want made into your fantasy wrestling web site, go ahead and execute run.py. 

```bash
python run.py
```

Any errors will be displayed in the console window.  If there are no errors, your files will all be built, ready to upload to your web server in a directory named 'public'.

You can also choose to only build certain elements, such as 'wrestlers'.  The various page generation scripts are found within the 'bin' directory, named 'gen_*.py'.  For example, to build or rebuild only 'wrestlers', you would run:

```bash
python bin/gen_wrestlers.py
```

## The Future

SlamSim! is still in it's infancy.  Here are some possible future features that may be added.

* More prefs
* Console or graphical UI for adding content
* AI match writer
* Automatic tracking of wins/losses/draws
